=====================================Part1=====================================
We used the "strings ./target | grep -E '^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$'" command to extract strings
that have one or more characters in the range [A-Za-z0-9_]. To further narrow down
the result, we put '^' and '$' to filter out strings contain characters not in
the range. We put this command into a bash script "create_dictionary.sh" and stored each
line of output to a separate file in the dictionary/ folder to construct the dictionary.

Task1:
We added code to get the length of the file and read the whole file into a string and 
passed the string and length to the ip_parse() function being tested. We also added error 
checking to each File I/O calls to make sure that they works correctly so that the testing 
could focus on the ip_parse() function itself.
Task2:
We first cleared the original checksum as required in calculating the new checksum. Then
we read the IHL field in the IP header to get the length of the header. After having 
them done, we summed up each byte pair and stored in a 32-bit integer. Then, we took
the least 16-bit of the sum and added the deferred carries to the sum. In the end, we took
the one's complement of the 16-bit sum to be the checksum and wrote it back to the buffer.
